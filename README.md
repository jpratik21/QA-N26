Task 1
============
`Task 1` folder contains test suite for Monefy Android application.

Task 2
============
`Task 2` folder contains test suite in Microsoft Excel format. Summary:

* Test cases are prioritized as per business impact and they should be automated based on their priority.
* Test cases are automated considering following levels:
	
	- Functional Level: Improves feature stability but may not reflect end-user experience with the app
	- User Interface Level: Improves user experience but requires frequent update as api(s)/libraries change often
	
Task 3 
=============
Using Rest-Assured library, I've written automated test cases for REST API endpoints. These test cases primarily focusses on correct functionality of endpoints.
